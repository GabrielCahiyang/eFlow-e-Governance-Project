# eFlow Web

eFlow is an enterprise-grade, role-based work management and local governance application designed for Local Government Units (LGUs). The platform combines governed task and project lifecycles, inter-departmental proposal collaboration, statutory municipal fiscal control, and an integrated System-1/System-2 artificial intelligence architecture powered by a dedicated local DeepSeek reasoning engine and the Laya decision layer.

The system is built on React 18, TypeScript, Vite, the Vibe Design System, Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security and Realtime events), and a local JWT-protected Python FastAPI control gateway.

---

## Architecture Overview

eFlow utilizes a distributed, multi-tiered architecture that separates browser execution, relational data governance, administrative control gateways, and local hardware-accelerated AI inference.

### Architectural Boundaries and Ingress Guarantees

1. **Private AI Loopback Boundary**: The model inference server runs strictly on private loopback address `127.0.0.1:8321`. Direct external access to port `8321` is prohibited. All client AI requests must pass through the authenticated control gateway on port `8322`.
2. **Zero-Trust Client Ingress**: Remote clients never receive the internal model authorization key (`llm_auth_key`) or Supabase service-role keys. Clients authenticate using their active Supabase session JWT. The control gateway validates the JWT, enforces active-profile checks, and proxies the request to the loopback AI server.
3. **Dynamic Cloudflare Tunnel Discovery**: The AI supervisor manages a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel targeting gateway port `8322`. The active tunnel hostname, heartbeat timestamp, and health status are automatically published to Supabase table `system_config`. Client browsers subscribe to `system_config` via Supabase Realtime, enabling automatic endpoint rotation without frontend rebuilds or manual URL entry.
4. **FIFO Hardware Protection**: The local node processes one DeepSeek reasoning job at a time in GPU VRAM. Additional requests receive assigned queue positions and poll until completion, eliminating GPU memory exhaustion and concurrency collisions.
5. **Decoupled System Availability**: The gateway and tunnel remain available for administrative, task, and project workflows while the AI process restarts. If the local model node is offline or restarting, normal non-AI operations continue uninterrupted, while AI-dependent screens display explicit status messages.

## Role-Based Governance Matrix

eFlow enforces a strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) framework aligned with Philippine Local Government Unit structures:

| Role Identifier | Role Title | Primary Workspaces | Governance Scope |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `superadmin` | Super Administrator | User Management, Organization Hierarchy, Entitlements, Backup & Export, Audit Logs, System Settings | Global configuration, identity recovery, disaster recovery, read-only oversight across operational projects and tasks. |
| `depthead` | Department Head / Assistant Head | Overview, Projects, Task Board, Team Supervision, Team Intelligence, Proposal Cockpit, Department Budgets, Reports | Office operations, annual budget appropriation locking, team workload balancing, proposal drafting, inter-departmental review. |
| `teamleader` | Team Leader | Work I'm Leading, Leader Reviews, Task Milestones, Subtask Allocation, Petty Cash Endorsements | Direct execution supervision, subtask ordering and assignment, evidence review, task budget distribution to subtasks. |

## Core Operational Workflows

### 1. Governed Task Lifecycle and Non-Repudiation

Task management in eFlow follows an audited lifecycle designed for local government compliance:

- **State Progression**: `Draft` -> `Open / In Progress` -> `In Review` -> `Changes Requested` -> `Approved / Completed` -> `Archived`.
- **Reviewer Designation and Authorization**: Each task defines primary and backup reviewers. Self-review is strictly prevented at both the database RLS level and gateway boundary.
- **Evidence-Based Submissions**: Submitting work for review requires verifiable evidence (documentation links, file attachments, or qualitative proof). Evidence records are immutable once submitted.
- **Audited Review Decisions**: Approvals and rejection attempts are recorded with timestamped reviewer notes. Approved submissions generate an SHA-256 cryptographic audit hash stored directly in the audit record.
- **Subtask Hierarchy and Dependency**: Subtasks support explicit parent-child sequencing, prerequisite dependencies, and dedicated assignees. Task leaders maintain drag-and-drop ordering authority through atomic reorder RPCs.

### 2. Inter-Department Proposal Collaboration & AI Decomposition

Municipal initiatives requiring cross-department coordination are managed through a persistent, versioned proposal engine:

- **PDF Ingestion & AI-Required Decomposition**: Proposal source documents are parsed client-side via PDF.js and dispatched to the local DeepSeek R1 8B node via the gateway.
  - The model performs Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) extraction, generating actionable activities, tasks, skills, and subtasks.
  - The output is immediately piped through the **Laya Decision Layer**, which applies heuristic System-1 governance logic:
    - Automatically routes tasks to responsible departments (IT, GSO/Procurement, CPDO, LEDIPO, BPLO, Budget, HRMO).
    - Detects statutory clearance requirements (Bids and Awards Committee / BAC resolutions, Petty Cash / Cash Advance, or standard execution).
    - Classifies priority and urgency (`High`, `Med`, `Low`) based on critical-path schedules.
    - Evaluates municipal staff skill vectors to recommend optimal personnel assignments.
  - Strict AI Integrity Contract: eFlow enforces an AI-required boundary. If the AI model is offline or returns invalid output, the application displays an explicit error. It never fabricates a silent fallback proposal.
- **Collaborative Draft Governance**:
  - Proposing departments draft and refine proposals in the `DraftCockpit`.
  - External entities participate under defined tiers: `Required Approver`, `Consulted`, or `Observer`.
  - Approval policies support quorum-based, all-signer, or sequential governance paths.
  - Board/Committee reviews generate formal meeting minutes and print-ready decision packets.
  - Committing an approved revision atomically materializes projects, milestones, task hierarchies, and team memberships within a single database transaction.

### 3. Department Fiscal Control and Petty Cash Operations

Fiscal management enforces strict accountability tied to actual project delivery:

- **Locked Annual Appropriations**: The Department Head locks the fiscal year budget. Proposals cannot be published without allocating funds against valid budget line items.
- **Proposal Budget Reservation**: Publication of a proposal atomically reserves the total required budget from the annual appropriation, creating immutable operational budget lines.
- **Subtask Budget Distribution**: Team Leaders allocate task funding to operational subtasks. Contributors request cash directly within their assigned subtask context.
- **Two-Stage Petty Cash Operations**:
  - Default daily release ceiling: Configurable ₱30,000 per day.
  - Default review threshold: Configurable ₱5,000 per receipt.
  - Request Chain: Contributor initiates request -> Team Leader provides first-stage review -> Department Head / Assistant Head issues final release approval.
  - Recipient Acknowledgement: Releases require formal recipient acknowledgement before funds are marked disbursed.
  - 15-Day Liquidation Window: Contributors submit receipt packages within 15 calendar days. Late packages require explicit Department Head approval.
  - Financial Settlement: Accounting staff perform journal posting, record returned unspent cash, and reconcile balanced ledger entries.

### 4. Process Optimization, Genetic Algorithms and Workforce Intelligence

- **PyGAD Genetic Algorithm Optimizer**: Integrates multi-objective heuristic optimization to solve the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). Supports three profiles:
  - `balanced`: Harmonizes skill overlap (35%), workload leveling (25%), risk aversion (20%), and timeline makespan (15%).
  - `fast_track`: Minimizes makespan by parallelizing independent critical-path tasks (45% schedule weight).
  - `low_risk`: Strictly avoids employee burnout thresholds and penalizes known skill gaps (35% risk weight).
- **Burnout Prediction Radar (HRMO)**: Evaluates live active task load, review backlog, and overtime signals to prevent municipal staff overload.
- **Manila Monthly Productivity Leaderboard**: Computes objective monthly contribution scores (delivery, quality, speed, collaboration) based strictly on Manila timezone calendar periods. To prevent perverse incentives, leaderboard metrics are strictly excluded from AI proposal staffing recommendations.

### 5. Polygon Blockchain Governance Ledger

For non-repudiation and external compliance, project milestones are anchored to the Polygon Amoy Testnet (Chain ID `80002`):

- **Calldata-Only Architecture**: Computes canonical SHA-256 digests of proposal payloads and dispatches 0-MATIC transactions with the hash embedded in the transaction payload.
- **Genesis & Milestone Receipts**: Records proposal creation, BAC statutory clearances, cash advance approvals, and project completion.
- **Public Auditability**: Anyone with the transaction hash or document digest can verify the authenticity and chronological timestamp on the public blockchain explorer without centralized dependency.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (Node 20+ recommended)
- **Python 3.10+** (Python 3.11/3.12 recommended)
- **Git**
- **PostgreSQL / pg_dump** (Installed locally or via pgAdmin for Super Admin backup features)
- **Supabase Project** (Cloud instance or local Docker Supabase instance)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository and install frontend dependencies**:
   ```powershell
   Set-Location "C:\Users\gabri\OneDrive\Desktop\EflowWeb"
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following configuration:
   ```env
   # Frontend Supabase Configuration (Browser visible)
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

   # eFlow Control Gateway Configuration (Private, used by server/start.py)
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=sb_secret_your_private_service_role_key

   # Database Connection for Super Admin Backup & Export (Private, server-only)
   EFLOW_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.your-project:your-password@aws-0-region.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres

   # Local Gateway and AI Ingress Settings
   EFLOW_GATEWAY_ORIGIN=http://127.0.0.1:8322
   VITE_AI_CONNECTION_MODE=online
   ```
   > Note: Never place the Supabase service-role key or database URI in `VITE_` variables. All `VITE_` variables are bundled into the client build.

3. **Start the eFlow development environment**:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```
   `npm run dev` concurrently executes:
   - **eFlow Control Gateway** on `127.0.0.1:8322` (automatically provisions `server/.venv`, installs requirements from `server/requirements.txt`, and enables auto-reload).
   - **Vite Frontend** on `http://localhost:5173`.

### Running eFlow with the Dedicated AI Server

To enable local AI proposal decomposition, Laya governance routing, and PyGAD optimization, run both repositories in separate terminals:

```powershell
# Terminal 1: eFlow Frontend & Control Gateway
Set-Location "..\eflow-e-Governance-Project" # or "C:\Users\gabri\OneDrive\Desktop\EflowWeb"
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Private AI Inference Node & Tunnel Supervisor
Set-Location "..\Ollama reactjs LLM DeepSeek Integration"
npm run dev
```

If the AI node processes become stale or require cleanup, execute the scoped restart utility in Terminal 2:
```powershell
npm run restart
```
*(This cleans up stale llama-cpp, uvicorn, and cloudflared processes without interrupting eFlow).*

---

## Quality Assurance & Verification

Before committing code or declaring a development slice complete, execute the full verification suite:

```powershell
# 1. TypeScript static analysis
npm run check

# 2. Vitest unit and regression tests
npm test

# 3. Production Vite build validation
npm run build

# 4. Security verification (ensures no service-role secrets exist in dist/)
npm run verify:client-secrets

# 5. Live Supabase database schema contract check
npm run verify:live-schema

# 6. Python gateway unit tests
python -m unittest discover -s server/tests -p "test_*.py" -v
```

### End-to-End Smoke Testing (Playwright)

To execute authenticated browser end-to-end tests:
```powershell
$env:EFLOW_E2E = "1"
$env:EFLOW_E2E_ACCOUNTS = '[{"role":"superadmin","email":"admin@eflow.local","password":"your_test_password"}]'
npm run test:e2e
```
